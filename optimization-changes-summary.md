# Emacs Configuration Optimization Summary

## Changes Applied Successfully

All requested optimizations have been implemented:

### 1. Display Line Numbers Optimization ✓
- Added global configuration with `display-line-numbers-type 'relative`
- Added `display-line-numbers-width-start t`
- Moved to global mode with selective disabling for specific modes
- Added hooks to disable in: org, term, eshell, pdf-view, dired, eww, erc modes

### 2. Lazy Loading for Heavy Packages ✓
- **org-mode**: Added `:defer t` and `:commands` for lazy loading
- **magit**: Added `:commands` list and moved keybinding to `:init` section

### 3. Native Compilation Optimization ✓
- Set `native-comp-async-jobs-number` to `(min 4 (num-processors))`
- Updated JIT compilation deny list with more selective patterns
- Added exclusions for git/svn/hg directories and temporary files

### 4. Built-in Completion Enhancements ✓
- Changed `completion-auto-help` from 'visible to 'lazy
- Added comprehensive `completion-styles` configuration
- Added `completion-category-overrides` for file/buffer/info-menu
- Updated `completion-preview-minimum-symbol-length` to 3
- Added `completion-preview-insert-on-completion t`
- Added Emacs 30 specific settings: `completions-detailed`, `completions-format`, `completions-max-height`

### 5. EXWM Monitor Detection Simplification ✓
- Replaced complex monitor detection with simple `xrandr --auto`
- Added caching mechanism for workspace configuration
- Reduced subprocess spawning with cached config

### 6. Security Enhancements ✓
- **Auth-source**: Added `auth-source-save-behavior nil` and `auth-source-do-cache nil`
- Disabled passphrase caching: `epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption nil`
- **Network Security**: Added `gnutls-verify-error t`, increased `gnutls-min-prime-bits` to 2048
- Set `network-security-level` to 'high
- Moved NSM settings file to temp directory

### 7. Replaced delight with :diminish ✓
- Removed delight package entirely
- Added `:diminish` to autorevert, flyspell (with custom lighter), yasnippet
- Removed delight configuration for eat modes

## Validation Results

- **Syntax Check**: Both init.el and early-init.el pass `check-parens`
- **Loading Test**: Both files load successfully
- **Byte Compilation**: Shows warnings for missing packages (expected) but no critical errors

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should result in:
- Faster startup time (lazy loading of org and magit)
- Better responsiveness (reduced GC pressure, optimized native compilation)
- More efficient completion (lazy help, better preview settings)
- Improved security (no password caching, enhanced TLS settings)
- Cleaner modeline (using built-in :diminish instead of delight)

## Next Steps

1. Restart Emacs to apply all changes
2. Run `M-x emacs-init-time` to check startup performance
3. Install/update packages as needed
4. Monitor system performance with reduced native compilation jobs
