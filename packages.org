* Analysis Summary

** Packages that could be replaced with built-in alternatives

*** High Priority (Good built-in alternatives exist)
1. *smartparens* → electric-pair-mode
2. *vertico* → icomplete-vertical-mode  
3. *orderless* → flex completion style
4. *multiple-cursors* → keyboard macros
5. *expand-region* → mark-word, mark-sexp
6. *windower* → winner-mode
7. *pulsar* → pulse.el
8. *yasnippet* → skeleton-mode + abbrev-mode
9. *eat* → term-mode or ansi-term

*** Medium Priority (Partial alternatives)
1. *rainbow-delimiters* → show-paren-mode (less colorful)
2. *highlight-thing* → hi-lock-mode
3. *indent-bars* → display-fill-column-indicator-mode
4. *diff-hl* → vc-diff indicators
5. *magit* → vc-mode (significantly fewer features)
6. *helpful* → built-in help system
7. *consult* → built-in commands (less powerful)
8. *pdf-tools* → doc-view-mode
9. *sly* → inferior-lisp-mode

*** Low Priority (No good alternatives)
1. *marginalia* - Unique annotation system
2. *nerd-icons* - No built-in icon support
3. *forge* - GitHub/GitLab integration
4. *denote* - Unique note-taking system
5. *org-modern* - Purely aesthetic
6. *ef-themes* - Additional themes
7. *gcmh* - Specialized GC handling
8. *exec-path-from-shell* - Shell environment import

** Recommendations

1. **Keep External**: Packages like magit, denote, consult, and marginalia provide significant value over built-in alternatives.

2. **Consider Replacing**: 
   - smartparens → electric-pair-mode (simpler, built-in)
   - yasnippet → skeleton-mode (if you don't need complex templates)
   - multiple-cursors → keyboard macros (for simple cases)
   - windower → winner-mode (simpler window management)

3. **Already Using Built-ins Well**: Your configuration already uses many built-in packages effectively (eglot, project.el, treesit, flymake, etc.)
