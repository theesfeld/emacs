# EXWM Monitor Configuration Simplification

## Changes Made

I've simplified your EXWM monitor configuration to use only built-in functionality:

### What was changed:

1. **Removed custom monitor function** - The `my/exwm-randr-screen-change-hook` function has been commented out, as EXWM can handle basic monitor changes automatically.

2. **Updated monitor names** - Configured with your actual monitor names:
   - `DP-1-1-6` (workspaces 0-4)
   - `DP-1-2` (workspaces 5-9)

3. **Simplified keybinding** - The `s-p` key now directly calls `exwm-randr-refresh` instead of a custom function.

### Current minimal configuration:

```elisp
;; Minimal monitor configuration using built-in EXWM functionality
(setq exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist
      '(0 "DP-1-1-6" 1 "DP-1-1-6" 2 "DP-1-1-6" 3 "DP-1-1-6" 4 "DP-1-1-6"
        5 "DP-1-2" 6 "DP-1-2" 7 "DP-1-2" 8 "DP-1-2" 9 "DP-1-2"))

;; Keybinding to manually refresh monitors
(global-set-key (kbd "s-p") #'exwm-randr-refresh)
```

### If you need custom xrandr settings:

The hook is commented out but available if you need specific monitor positioning:

```elisp
;; (add-hook 'exwm-randr-screen-change-hook
;;           (lambda ()
;;             (start-process-shell-command
;;              "xrandr" nil
;;              "xrandr --output DP-1-1-6 --auto --primary --output DP-1-2 --auto --right-of DP-1-1-6")))
```

### Benefits:

- **Simpler** - Uses only EXWM's built-in randr functionality
- **More reliable** - No custom code that could break
- **Easier to maintain** - Just update monitor names if they change

### Usage:

- EXWM will automatically detect monitor changes and apply the workspace assignments
- Press `s-p` to manually refresh monitors if needed
- Your laptop display (eDP-1) is not assigned any workspaces, so all 10 workspaces will appear on your external monitors
